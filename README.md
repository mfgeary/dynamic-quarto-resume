# `rresume`

Welcome to `rresume`! This is an `R` package made to programmatically generate your resume and CV. While I can't take out all the hard work of writing up with great content for your resume, I want to make it easier to create a resume that is tailored to each position you apply for.

This package is still in development, but I hope to have a working version soon as I plan to use this on my own job search.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rresume` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mfgeary/rresume")
```
